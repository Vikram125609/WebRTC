A middleware function is a function that gets executed for every incoming connection.
Usage of middelware in socket.io
1. Logging 
2. Authentication
3. Rate Limiting

Note: this function will be executed only once per connection (even if the connection consists in multiple HTTP requests).

Basic Emit 
The Socket.IO API is inspired from the Node.js EventEmitter, which means you can emit events on one side and register listeners on the other:

Acknowledgement in socket.io
Events are great, but in some cases you may want a more classic request-response API. In Socket.IO, this feature is named acknowledgements.

Server side 
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.on("update item", (arg1, arg2, callback) => {
    console.log(arg1); // 1
    console.log(arg2); // { name: "updated" }
    callback({
      status: "ok"
    });
  });
});

Client side 
socket.emit("update item", "1", { name: "updated" }, (response) => {
  console.log(response.status); // ok
});


What is web socket ?
Web socket is a computer communication protocol providing full duplex communication channel over a 
single tcp connection 

The HTTP 1.1 (only) Upgrade header can be used to upgrade an already established client/server
connection to a different protocol (over the same transport protocol). For example, it can be used 
by a client to upgrade a connection from HTTP 1.1 to HTTP 2.0, or an HTTP or HTTPS connection into a
WebSocket.

What is polling ? 
For example when i want to make a chat application without using web Socket for there is one bad
idea to this. lets assume there are two machine and one server is there 

User A will have to send request to the client weather is there any message for him or not everytime to the server 
in the same way the other user have to send requet to the serve to check weather there is message for him or not

When user A make a post request to the Server for the user B. The server will not send the respone directly to the user B 
the user B has to make a request weather there is a message for me or not then the server will send the message and same 
for the user A 

the continous checking to the server for the message is called polling
